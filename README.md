# STOP WATCH

A stopwatch is a handheld timekeeping device used to measure the amount of time elapsed between a starting point and an ending point. It typically features a set of buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer. Stopwatches are commonly used in various activities where precise timing is important, such as sports, science experiments, and other time-sensitive applications.
